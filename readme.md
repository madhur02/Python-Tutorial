# Python programming tutorial for beginners
This is a concise Python 3 programming tutorial for people who think that reading is boring. I try to show everything with simple code examples; there are no long and complicated explanations with fancy words. If you have never programmed before click here to find out what programming is like and get started.

This tutorial is aimed at people with no programming experience at all or very little programming experience. If you have programmed a lot in the past using some other language you may want to read the official tutorial instead.

You can use Python 3.5 or any newer Python with this tutorial. Don't use Python 2 because it's no longer supported.

## List of contents
The tutorial consists of Jupyter Notebook where i have used simple commands to explain python concepts.

### Basics Python Notebooks
This section will get you started with using Python and you'll be able to learn more about whatever you want after studying it.

1. [Python Data Types](https://github.com/madhur02/PythonLearning/blob/main/Python%20Class%20notes%20Lecture%201%20-%204.ipynb) - i) Numbers
                     ii) String
                     iii) List
                     iv) Boolean
                     v) Set                    
                     vi) Dictionary
2. Logical Operations & Comparision Operations .if-elif, else Statements.
3. [File Operations](https://github.com/madhur02/PythonLearning/blob/main/Python%20Lecture%205%20File%20Operations.ipynb) : Python has a built-in open function that allows us to open and play with basic file types. First we will need a file though. We're going to use some IPython magic to create a text file!.
4. [OS Commands](https://github.com/madhur02/PythonLearning/blob/main/Python%20Lecture%206%20OS%20Commands.ipynb): The OS module in Python provides functions for creating and removing a directory (folder), fetching its contents, changing and identifying the current directory, etc.
5. [Errors & Exception Handling](https://github.com/madhur02/PythonLearning/blob/main/Python%20Lecture%207(Continued)%20-Errors%20and%20Exceptions%20Handling.ipynb) : 
6. [Object Oriented Programming](https://github.com/madhur02/PythonLearning/blob/main/Python%20Lecture%208%20_%209%20-Object%20Oriented%20Programming.ipynb) : For this lesson we will construct our knowledge of OOP in Python by building on the following topics:
    * Objects
    * Using the class keyword
    * Creating class attributes
    * Creating methods in a class
    * Learning about Inheritance
    * Learning about Polymorphism
    * Learning about Special Methods for classes
